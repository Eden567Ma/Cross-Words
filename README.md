# Cross-Word 

## Basis Description :

> Build an application capable of constructing crossword puzzles. The overall objective is a program that takes a dictionary and a blank grid as input and outputs a solved grid.

## Functionality:

_Input_:
        The program should accept a dictionary containing a list of words.
        It should also accept a blank crossword grid. The grid should have empty spaces for words to be filled in and may contain black squares to indicate spaces where words cannot be placed.

_Processing_:
        The application should utilize the dictionary and grid to generate a solved crossword puzzle.
        It should place words from the dictionary into the grid, ensuring they fit correctly with the existing letters and intersecting words.

_Output_:
        Once the puzzle is solved, the program should output the completed grid with all words filled in.

For instance, a possible blank grid is represented below. It consists of 12 word slots, with the first boxes of each word slot numbered from 0 to 11. We consider crossword puzzles as grids where each square is either filled (black) or empty (white).





## _Note_:
The program will to handle various grid sizes and configurations.
It will mplement efficient algorithms for solving the crossword puzzle within a reasonable time frame, especially for larger puzzles and dictionaries.
The application's user interface could provide options for customizing the puzzle generation process, such as selecting grid size, word lengths, and difficulty level.
